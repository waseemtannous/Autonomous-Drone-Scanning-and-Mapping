# Autonomous Drone Scanning and Mapping


***Lecturer: Prof. Dan Feldman***


The objective of the course is to make a drone (DJI Tello) autonomously scan the area, find the exit and navigate between the rooms in a closed area or a house.

The code was developed using Python. An external SLAM software was used (ORB_SLAM2 [1]) to scan the area and to generate a point cloud which is then analyzed and used to make decisions of the drone’s next destination.

A thorough report was conducted and can be found in the 'documents' folder.
